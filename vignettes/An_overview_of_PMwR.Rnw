\noindent The aim of \textsc{pm}w\textsc{r} is to
provide a small set of reliable, efficient and convenient
tools that help in processing and analysing trade and
portfolio data. The package does not provide a complete
application to be used `as is', but tools
for creating such an application.

\noindent The package grew out of various pieces of
software that I have written since 2008.%
\footnote{In the unlikely case that you come across a
  really-old version of the package: it was called
  \textsc{pm} before 2012.} %
The package is under active development and changes
frequently, simply because the code has been written
over many years and is in need of being groomed for
general use.%
\footnote{
<<echo=false>>=
test.rep <- readLines(system.file("unitTests/test_results.txt",
                                  package = "PMwR"))
nt <- gsub(".*\\(([0-9]+) checks?\\).*", "\\1",
           test.rep[grep("\\(\\d+ checks?\\)", test.rep)])
@
Even if \textsc{pm}w\textsc{r} is under development:
the package is to provide well-documented and reliable
code.  For all computations, unit tests are included.
As of package version %
\Sexpr{pv}, there are \Sexpr{sum(as.numeric(nt))} tests
included.  These tests are stored in subdirectory
\texttt{unitTests}.} %

Specifically, interfaces to functions may not be stable
yet (e.g., argument names are currently being made
consistent across functions); in some cases, generic
functions may be introduced. The \textbf{recommended
  practice} is therefore to \textbf{explicitly name
  arguments in function calls} and not pass arguments
by position. Any changes in argument names will be
documented in the \textsc{news} file
(\,\url{http://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/PMwR/NEWS}\,)
and so can be easily followed. More details
are in the ChangeLog
(\,\url{http://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/PMwR/ChangeLog}\,).

The very latest version of the package is available from
\url{http://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/PMwR/}. To install the
package from within R, type
<<eval=false, results=hide>>=
install.packages('PMwR',
                 repos = c('http://enricoschumann.net/R', getOption('repos')))
@
within a session. The package depends on several other
packages, which can be obtained from the same
repository and from \textsc{cran}.

There is currently no automatic Windows build for the
latest version. If you wish to use the package on
Windows and have problems building/installing it, then
please contact me and I will provide you with a Windows
version.

I am grateful for comments, suggestions and
corrections.  Please send bug reports directly to the
package maintainer, for instance by using
\texttt{bug.report}.\index{bug reports}

utils::bug.report("[PMwR] Unexpected behaviour in function <XXX>",

\section*{What the package provides}

There are three main topics for which the package
provides functionality:

\begin{description}
\item[Keep track of transactions] The package provides
  functions that work with journals (sometimes called
  blotters). See \texttt{?journal} and
  \texttt{?position}.
\item[Computing \textsc{p}\&\textsc{l} and returns] See
  \texttt{?pl}, \texttt{?returns}, \texttt{?rc} and
  \texttt{?unit\_prices}.
\item[Testing strategies] See \texttt{?btest}.
\end{description}

Several examples will be provided in the next section.
Other than that, there are a number of helper
functions. All details are in the manual:

\section*{Examples}

\subsection*{Keeping track of transactions}

Suppose you have traded financial futures.

summary(J)

position(J, when)

\subsection*{Computing P\&L and Returns}

We continue the previous example.

pl(J)

pl(along.timestamp, vprice)

\subsection*{Testing investment strategies}

<<>>=
library("PMwR")
timestamp <- as.Date(row.names(DAX))
P <- DAX[[1]]

signal <- function(k) {
  av <- sum(Close(n = k))/k
  if (Close() > av)
    1
  else
    -1
}

btest(P, signal, k = 5,
      b = 5)
